# 题目描述
You're given strings `J` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `S`representing the stones you have.  Each character in `S` is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in `J` are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in `J` and `S` are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

题意就是给定两个字符串序列，J 中包含宝石的种类（大小写敏感且不重复），要你判断 S 中有多少石头属于 J 中的宝石类型。

# 代码实现
把 J 放入 Set<Character> ，然后 S 逐个判断就行了。
```Java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {

	        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<Character>();
	        for (char c : J.toCharArray()) {
				set.add(c);
			}
	        
	        int cnt = 0;
	        for (char c : S.toCharArray()) {
				if (set.contains(c)) {
					cnt++;
				}
			}
	        return cnt;
	    }
}
```
